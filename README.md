about_me = "
I'm Dawid, a Software Engineer based in Częstochowa, Poland. I specialize in Python and Backend development.
My focus is bridging the gap between classic engineering and Machine Learning & AI.

Most recently, I worked as a Software Developer at Nokia, where I automated tests and maintained CI/CD pipelines
using Robot Framework, Docker, and Wireshark.
I also developed CLI tools that streamlined release processes for the internal team.

Currently, I'm building End-to-End ML systems (check out my F1 project!)
and I'm open to new opportunities as a Python or ML Engineer.

Beyond the screen, I capture moments through photography and explore the world on hikes and nature trips.
Always learning, always building.
